## 1.2. <a name="PURPOSE"></a> Purpose: A toolchain for specifying and implementing Erlang `gen_statem` programs using mixed-choice multiparty session types

This artifact demonstrates the prototype toolchain presented in the
submitted paper.

Acronyms:

- MST = Multiparty Session Types
- EFSM = Event-driven State Machine (a la Erlang's [`gen_statem`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/statem.html))

As described in the paper (mainly Secs. 2.2 and 5), a programmer follows two
main steps:

1. **Specify the message passing protocol** using our mixed-choice extension of the Scribble protocol language.  
   Our tool statically validates the syntactic conditions for well-formedness
   based on our theory in the paper.
   If valid, it generates, for each role in the protocol, two Erlang modules:
   - **A protocol-enforcing generic behaviour module -- `gen_<role>.erl`**  
     This module is a library that programmers use but do not modify.  It
     provides a protocol- and role-specific `gen_statem` wrapper that enforces
     the protocol rules for the given role.  It encapsulates the EFSM logic
     derived from the protocol for this role, including state transitions,
     message handling, and the runtime mechanisms for mixed-choice and garbage
     collection.  It exposes a public API for sending messages.  
     (The terminology "generic behaviour" is from Erlang -- to reiterate: this
     module is specifically for the given protocol and role.)
   - **A template callback module -- `<role>.erl`**  
     This module is generated to provide a template implementation of a user
     program on top of the above module.  The code generation creates
     placeholder callback functions for handling the EFSM events.  The
     programmer can modify and add to these to implement the required
     application-specific logic (e.g., local computations after receiving a
     message, internal decisions for selecting protocol choices, etc).

2. **Adapt and complete the generated template programs.**  
The programmer can complete the program as follows.
    -   Modify and add to the placeholder functions in the template
        (`<role>.erl`) the specific logic for the application.
    -   Configure how the different roles will be launched and connected at
        startup.  This may include:
        -   Launching a process for each role in the protocol.
        -   Distributing the initial contact information (process IDs) so the
            roles know how to communicate with each other (the connection function generated in `<role>.erl` can be used for that.
        -   Providing supervision of these processes for fault-tolerance.

## 1.3. <a name="CLAIMS"></a> Claims


The main statement in the submitted paper: (Apologies, we did not
format it as an explicit "Data-Availability Statement" section.)

> l.1067 **<em>We will submit our implementation, examples and RabbitMQ case study as an artifact.</em>**

Our Docker image supports these claims by providing these materials:

- The source code of:
  - Our Scribble-based tool for validating protocols and generating Erlang
    `gen_statem` code.
  - All the example protocols from Table 1 along with their pre-generated (and
    minimally implemented) Erlang code.
  - rabbitmq-server with a replaced amqp_selective_consumer module following our framework.
- Scripts and a preconfigured Erlang/OTP environment with `rebar3` (the
  official Erlang build tool) for building and running all of the above.

# 2. <a name="HARDWARE"></a> Hardware dependencies

Our artifact has no specific hardware requirements.

# 3. <a name="START"></a> Getting started guide


## 3.1. <a name="INITIAL"></a> Initial set up and test

**Prerequisites**.

- Docker is installed and running – e.g., see this
  [tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

Notes on the artifact.

- This docker image has been tested on following environment as the host machine:
  - MacOS 14.7.1, on a MacBook Pro with 1.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 and 16GB RAM.
  - MacOS 15.3.1, on a MacBook Pro with M1 and 16GB RAM.
  - MacOS 15.5, on a MacBook Pro with M4 and 16GB RAM.
  - Windows 10, Intel Core i5 @ 2.6 GHz (4 cores) and 16GB RAM.

<!--
- The artifact Docker image has `vim` and `nano` preinstalled.
-->


**Steps** for starting from scratch.

1. Put the Docker image `oopsla2425-paper672-artifact.tar.gz` in some
   local directory.  In these steps, we will refer to this directory as
   `$MY_LOCAL_DIR`.

2. Check that Docker is running.

3. Load the image and launch a container with an interactive session.  
   In `$MY_LOCAL_DIR`, do:
   ```sh
   docker load -i oopsla2425-paper672-artifact.tar.gz
   docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash scribble-gt
   ```

4. **Test: Protocol validation and code generation.**
    The simplest way to check that the toolchain is working is to run the main script that processes all of our example protocols. This will validate each protocol and generate the corresponding Erlang code.
    Inside the container, run:
    ```sh
    ./mMST.sh -run-scribble-examples
    ```
    **Expected output**.
    The script will loop through all `.scr` protocol files under `examples/scribble/`, validating and projecting each of them. It should complete without errors.
    The generated Erlang code will be written to `generated/<ProtocolName>/`.

    To run all implemented Erlang examples: 
    ```sh
    ./mMST.sh -run-erlang-examples
    ```

    **Expected output**.
    The script will loop through all Erlang/OTP applications under `generated_otp_app/`, compiling each of them and then starting/stopping the application (non-interactively). It should complete without errors.

5. **Test: Compile and run an Erlang example.**
    Let's run the `CircuitBreaker` example.
    Inside the container, go to the example's directory and
    launch an Erlang shell using `rebar3`:
    ```sh
    cd examples/erlang/circuit_breaker
    rebar3 shell
    ```
    Inside the Erlang shell (you'll see a `===> Verifying dependencies...` message followed by an Erlang prompt `1>`), start the application:
    ```rebar3
    application:start(circuit_breaker).
    ```
    **Expected output**.
    You will see log messages from the different roles (API, Controller, Storage, User) as they interact according to the protocol. Debug logs (`*DBG*`) from the generated gen_<role>.erl modules provide detailed information about events internal to the EFSM, such as message receptions, consumptions, and state transitions, which verify correct protocol execution.
   The output should look similar to the following (though the exact interleaving and branch choices may vary due to random selection):
   ```
    ok
    *DBG* usr consume internal init_state in state s1
    2> Controller: s1 Sending start_storage to Storage 
    *DBG* controller receive internal {start_controller} in state s1
    *DBG* storage receive cast {<0.142.0>,{start_storage}} in state s1
    Storage: s1 Received start_storage from Controller <0.142.0>
    *DBG* controller consume internal {start_storage} in state s1 => s3
    *DBG* storage receive internal {hard_ping} in state s1
    Controller: s3 Sending start_controller to API 
    ...
    ```

6.  Stop the example.
    First, stop the application.  In the Erlang shell:
    ```rebar3
    application:stop(circuit_breaker).
    ```
    You can then exit the Erlang shell by pressing `ctrl+c`,
    or by entering `q().` and pressing Enter.

Modules found in the Base dir other than `scribble-gt` are just the
pre-existing modules inherited from base Scribble.  Our work for this artifact
is in specifically the mentioned `scribble-gt` module.
This repository is a standalone Scala codebase; our work for this artifact is in `src/`.

## 3.3. <a name="COMMANDS"></a> Main commands inside the container

Following [1.2](#PURPOSE), the two main activities supported by this artifact
container are:

- Use our tool to validate protocols and generate the protocol- and
  role-specific Erlang modules.
- Implement and run Erlang programs.


**Protocol validation and code generation**.
The main script is:  

```sh
./mMST.sh <<flag>> <<flagargs>> <protocolfile>
```

The `<protocolfile>` is a `.scr` file and is mandatory.  The other `<<..>>` elements are optional.

The following demonstrates usages and key flags.  Assume we are in the
`scribble-gt-scala` directory inside the container:

- Check a protocol file:
  ```sh
  ./mMST.sh examples/scribble/<FileName.scr>
  ```

- Generate the Erlang code for all roles in a protocol and write to file(s):
  ```sh
  ./mMST.sh examples/scribble/<FileName.scr>
  ```
  The output will be written to
  `generated/<ProtocolName>/`.

- Generate the Erlang code for a specific role in the protocol and write to
  file(s):
  ```sh
  ./mMST.sh -proto <ProtocolName> -roles <Role> examples/scribble/<FileName.scr>
  ```
  The output will be written to
  `generated/<ProtocolName>/`.

- Generate into a specific output directory:
  ```sh
  ./mMST.sh -out /tmp/generated examples/scribble/<FileName.scr>
  ```
  The output will be written to `/tmp/generated/<ProtocolName>/`.

- Enable idle GC support in the generated runtime:
  ```sh
  ./mMST.sh -gc examples/scribble/<FileName.scr>
  ```
  
- Remove generated files and build artifacts from the Erlang examples:
  ```sh
  ./mMST.sh -clean-all
  ```
  
**Notes on flags.**

`mMST.sh` is a thin wrapper around the Scala main class:

```sh
sbt "runMain com.github.rhu1.gt.codegen.CodegenCLI <path/to/file.scr> [-proto Name] (-all | -roles R1 R2 ...) [-out ./generated] [-gc]"
```

## 3.4. <a name="NOTES"></a> Additional notes

Warnings.

- Our implementation is set to print most errors noisily, e.g., full stack traces.  Look at the top of the trace for the error message.

Minor syntax/notation differences.

- Our implementation and examples use this syntax for mixed-choices:
  ```
  mixed { ... } or A -> B { ... }  // B is the "observer" of the MC.
  ```
  In the paper, we omitted the `A -> B` part as it can be easily
  inferred from the contents of the LHS and RHS brackets.
- Our current implementation moves the `@` annotation in Fig. 7 (LHS) to here:
  ```
  mixed {
      ...                 // As in the Fig.
  } or W @failed -> FD {  // @ annotation moved here.
      ...                 // As in the Fig but without the @ annotation.
  }
  ```
- Our current implementation  moves the `*` annotation in Fig. 7 (RHS) to
  here:
  ```
  Stop*() from P to Q;
  ```

Minor corrections.

- In Fig. 7 (RHS) in the paper:
  - Lines 5 and 6 should be swapped.
  - There should be an additional line `Ack() from Q to P;` between lines 9
    and 10.

Other notes.

- In the error messages of our tool:
  - The terminology "clear-termination" in our paper is often instead called "left committing".
  - The terminology "single-decision" in our paper is often instead called
    "right commiting".

- The protocol files are found in
  `examples/scribble`.
- The dir/application name is both:
  - The name of the subdirectory containing the example Erlang implementation,
    under `examples/erlang`.
  - The name to supply as an argument to `application:start` to run the
    application inside the Erlang shell (cf. [3.3](#COMMANDS)]).
- The Erlang code source dirs are specified for completeness.  They are under
  `examples/erlang`.

As mentioned in the paper (l.961), our example Erlang programs are *"minimal
but functional skeleton programs for each role of each example to test the
runtime I/O and event handling dynamics, and embedded MC mechanisms such as
stale message purging. However, our minimal implementations do not necessarily
perform the full application logic intended of each example."*

See [3.3](#COMMANDS) for the command line instructions for running each
example.

### Expected outputs.

The following briefly summarizes the expected output of each example in the
table from above.  

**Note:** the implementation uses random to select one branch or another, so the exact interleaving of some send/receive events may vary. Each trace in the table shows one valid execution; your console output should follow the same pattern of role-to-role messages but may differ in ordering or timing.


- &#8203;(1) **Calculator**

  This example demonstrates a distributed multiparty calculator protocol with branching, recursion, mixed choice, and garbage collection of stale messages.

### 4.1.2. <a name="RABBITMQ"></a> RabbitMQ Use Case

This section describes how to run the RabbitMQ case study mentioned in the paper. This example demonstrates the framework on a more complex, real-world protocol.

For the RabbitMQ case study, we model the protocol followed by `amqp_selective_consumer` in `examples/scribble`. 
We generate the `gen_amqp_selective_consumer.erl` and `amqp_selective_consumer.erl` modules, fully implement them, then swap them into `rabbitmq-server/deps/amqp-client/src/`. 
To test, run `make` in `examples/erlang/rabbitmq-server`. This will build the server and run its tests. The build should complete without errors.
